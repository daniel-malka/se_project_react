# AROUND THE USA: Back End project

Around-express project is a back-end project which focused on creating a server for the around-the-US application.
We'll create the logic of the platform's authorization, authentication, and all other client requests that are being sent to the server

We also gain a deeper understanding of how to work with non-relational databases (mongoDB), set up security using tokens, unit testing, and deploy web applications.

## Running the Project

javascript ES6 using destructuring syntax.
node.js, express.js,mongoDB, mongoose.
eslint tests, regex usage for various validations.
`npm run start` — to launch the server {PORT = 3001}

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature (nodemon)
